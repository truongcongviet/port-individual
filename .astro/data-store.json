This article is oriented towards non-technical participants in the Solana or any other Blockchain ecosystem with a superficial knowledge of how apps work.\n\n## Actions\n\nAn **Action** is an API that returns a Solana transaction to be viewed by the user and signed, and then executed on-chain. The transaction can be sent across various means like a button on a widget or website, QR codes similar to Solana Pay (It is built similar to Solana Pay specs, a look at the docs or codebase might show you that).\n\nSimply put, an Action is an API endpoint that will return metadata and prompts the user to sign with their wallet. It makes it simple for developers to integrate Solana blockchain transactions into their application’s user flow or even allowing users to interact with the blockchain without redirecting them from the app they were using like Twitter, Discord or even right here on Medium (If someone builds a provider for it, more on this later)\n\n### How Actions Work\n\nThe Actions API mostly consists of making HTTP requests to an Action URL endpoint and handling the responses that relate to the Action. A GET request returns metadata about what actions are available to the URL and an optional list of related actions, while a POST request returns a signable transaction that will be executed on-chain or on an off-chain service.\n\n#### Action API Flow\n\nThe way the flow works is:\n\n- You press a button or link or scan a QR code which prompts the Action Client to send a GET request to the Action Provider.\n\n- The provider responds with metadata and available actions and the client displays a UI with those actions\n\n- You interact with the Action and the client makes a POST request to the Provider with the pubkey you choose\n\n- The provider responds with a custom transaction and the client displays it on the UI\n\n- You approve the transaction and the sign it and the client sends the transaction to the blockchain and voilà!\n\nAs you can see, the client handles transaction submission and state management, including necessary validations and error handling. For example, if you want a certain transaction to only last a certain amount of time or be available to certain wallet addresses, actions also support a certain level of invalidation — The GET and POST request may return some metadata that states that the action cannot be executed (with a disabled field)\n\n## Blinks\n\n**Blinks** (short for blockchain links) extend the functionality of Solana Actions by turning them into shareable, metadata-rich links. These links enable clients, such as wallet extensions and bots, to present additional UI options for interacting with Solana Actions directly. Right now, Dialect is the most popular client provider that allows UI client modal rendering.\n\n### Linking Actions with Blinks\n\nA Blink can be linked to an Action in three ways:\n\n- Sharing an explicit Action URL like `solana-action:https://actions.alice.com/donate`. Here, only supported clients (like Dialect) can render the blink and there won’t be a fallback.\n\n- Sharing a link to a website linked to an Action API through an actions.json file on the root of the website.\n\n- Embedding the Action URL into the URL of a Blink provider (like Dialect) — https://blink.to/?action=\u003Caction_url>\n\n![Header Image](jupblink.png)\n\nHere you can see Jupiter’s Blink modal that uses an Action for buying DogWifHat tokens with Solana. The metadata specified in the action like buttons, description, etc. are displayed on the modal. For this to render, you need to download Dialect’s Blink Extension from the Chrome Web Store (Link at the end of the article). But in some cases, if you don’t have the extension installed it displays as a regular link as a fallback, so you can click on it to go to the client webpage with the same modal.\n\n## Uses of Actions & Blinks\n\nImagine you’re an artist who really like Farcaster frames but wish it was on Twitter as well. Now, you can create a Blink through Dialect linked to an Action that mints an NFT to the user. You post the Blink on Twitter and the client renders the mint page over the tweet similar to the Jupiter swap page. The same applies if you want to create a Donation blink for a charity, a DAO blink to get members of your DAO to vote easily on Twitter or a raffle blink to participate in sweepstakes!\n\nMost importantly, the Actions API helps streamline interacting on-chain to a simple set of HTTPS requests, which makes it easier for Web2 devs to integrate on-chain activity seamlessly into their application and not need to set up a whole token mint page or donation page on their own.\n\n## Important Links\n\nLearn more: [Solana Solutions](https://solana.com/solutions/actions)\n\nDocs: [Solana Docs](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/actions)\n\nGitHub Repo: [Solana Developers](https://github.com/solana-developers/solana-actions)\n\nDialect Extension: [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dialect-blinks/mhklkgpihchphohoiopkidjnbhdoilof)\n\n\u003Cstyle>\nimg {\n    border-radius: 25px;\n    width: 100%;\n}\n\u003C/style>","src/content/post/actions-and-blinks/index.md",[25],"jupblink.png","ed15ab2174ccaa78",{"html":28,"metadata":29},"\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Today, Solana Foundation announced the release of two innovative specifications — Actions &#x26; Blinks.

Basic MEV Definition:\n\n- MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) involves extracting value by manipulating transaction order\n- Transactions can be added, removed, or reordered within blocks\n- Searchers monitor chains to strategically place trades for value extraction\n\n2. MEV on Solana:\n\n- Functions differently due to unique architecture and no global mempool\n- Uses features like Turbine and Stake-Weighted QoS\n- Fast block production limits traditional MEV approaches\n- Searchers need own nodes or validator partnerships\n\n3. Understanding MEV:\n\n- Term has varied interpretations\n- Not all MEV is harmful\n- Complete elimination is considered unlikely\n- Networks claiming MEV elimination often lack activity or use questionable solutions\n\n4. Sandwiching:\n\n- Most prominent and harmful form of MEV\n- Involves placing transactions before and after target transaction\n- Profitable for searchers but increases costs for regular users\n- Negatively impacts execution prices\n\n## MEV Process\n\n### This report analyzes Solana’s current MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) landscape and is divided into four sections:\n\n1. **Forms of MEV**: Explores the various types of MEV observed on Solana today, supported by detailed examples.\n2. **MEV Mitigation Mechanism**s: Examines strategies and mechanisms aimed at reducing or eliminating harmful forms of MEV.\n\n### **_Forms of MEV_**\n\n### Liquidations\n\nWhen borrowers on lending protocols don’t maintain the required collateralization ratio, their loans can be liquidated. Searchers track these undercollateralized positions on the blockchain, repaying the debt to claim part of the collateral as a reward. This liquidation process, seen as good MEV, is vital for protocol solvency and supports the stability of the on-chain DeFi ecosystem.\n\n### Example:\n\nOn December 10, a liquidation took place on Kamino, Solana’s top lending protocol.\n\n- A searcher paid 10.642 USDC to settle a user’s debt, receiving 0.05479 SOL in collateral.\n- After paying a 0.0013 SOL protocol fee and a 0.001317 SOL priority fee,\n- The searcher earned a net profit of 0.0492 USD.\n\n![Liquidations](liquidity.jpg)\n\n### Front-running\n\n- **Front-running Defined**: An MEV searcher spots a trader’s order in the mempool and places a matching order first, profiting from the price shift.\n- **Mechanism**: They act on an unconfirmed transaction’s price impact before it’s processed.\n- **Simplicity**: Unlike sandwich attacks, it’s a straightforward strategy.\n- **Process**: The searcher buys before a target’s price-boosting order, bundling their transaction to go first.\n- **Profit**: They gain as the target’s trade raises the price.\n- **Target’s Loss**: The trader pays more due to the searcher’s earlier buy.\n\n### Back-runing\n\nBack-running, an MEV strategy opposite to front-running, exploits temporary price imbalances from a user’s transaction, often due to poor routing. After the transaction, searchers trade the same asset to balance prices across pools, earning a profit that the user could have gained with better execution.\n\n#### Example\n\n- **Event Overview**: On January 10, 2024, a user bought $8.9 million worth of DogWifHat (WIF) in one transaction.\n- **Market Context**: WIF traded at $0.2 with only a few million dollars in liquidity across all on-chain venues.\n- **Transaction Execution**: The Jupiter aggregator split the trade across three pools with limited liquidity, causing a price spike to $3.\n- **Back-run Execution**: A searcher used a Jito Bundle, paying a 890.42 SOL ($91,621) tip for priority.\n- **Step 1 - Purchase**: The searcher swapped 703.31 SOL ($72,368) for 490,143.90 WIF via a Raydium concentrated liquidity pool.\n- **Step 2 - Sale**: They then traded the WIF tokens for 19,035.97 SOL ($1,958,733) through a Raydium V4 pool.\n- **Profit Outcome**: The back-run netted a profit of 17,442.24 SOL ($1,794,746) in one transaction.\n- **Note**: All dollar values reflect prices at the time of the transaction.\n  ![back-runing](back.jpg)\n\n### Sandwich Attacks\n\n- **Sandwich Attacks Defined**: The most infamous toxic MEV, targeting traders on AMMs or bonding curves with high slippage tolerances.\n- **Trader Vulnerability**: Memecoin traders, chasing high returns, set high slippage for fast execution on illiquid, volatile assets, making them prime targets.\n- **Impact on Traders**: Sandwiching forces traders to fill orders at the worst possible price, creating a negative outcome.\n- **Attack Process**:\n  - Step 1 - Front-run: The attacker buys the asset unprofitably, pushing the price to the victim’s slippage limit.\n  - Step 2 - Victim’s Trade: The victim’s order executes at this high price, further inflating it.\n  - Step 3 - Back-run: The attacker sells profitably at the elevated price, offsetting losses and earning a net profit.\n- **Execution**: All three transactions are bundled atomically for success.\n\n#### Example Sandwich Attack Transaction\n\n**Event Overview**: A Sandwich attack occurred on December 16, 2024, via a known program (vpeNALD… Noax38b), executed as an atomic Jito bundle with a 0.000148 SOL ($0.03) tip. - **Front-run Transaction**: Searcher spent 14.63 SOL to buy 32.9 million Komeko tokens, a new meme coin on Pump Fun. - **Victim Transaction**: Victim swapped 0.33 SOL for 624,000 Komeko tokens. - **Back-run Transaction**: Searcher sold 32.9 million Komeko tokens for 14.65 SOL.\n![sandwich](sandwich.jpg)\n\n### **_MEV Mitigation Mechanism_**\n\nSubstantial resources are dedicated to studying and integrating general-purpose, out-of-protocol mechanisms into applications and infrastructure to mitigate or reallocate MEV and reduce its on-chain surface area.\n\n### Validator Whitelists\n\n- **Proposed Idea**: Stakers, RPC providers, and validators could ostracize sandwiching validators by skipping their leadership slots.\n- **Downsides**: Whitelists, a last-resort option, could delay transactions by seconds, harming user experience.\n- **Risks**: This risks a semi-permissioned, censored system, clashing with blockchain’s decentralized principles, and might exclude honest validators, eroding trust.\n- **Alternative**: Independent developers and apps can create their own validator allow/deny lists using the Helius Node.js SDK’s sendTransaction method.\n\n### Dynamic Slippage + MEV Protection\n\n- **Slippage Management Challenges**: Traditionally, users manually adjust slippage, a tedious task, especially for volatile or illiquid tokens like memecoins, where settings differ from stable assets.\n- **Jupiter’s Solution**: In August 2024, Jupiter Aggregator on Solana introduced dynamic slippage, an algorithm that adjusts slippage in real-time using heuristics based on:\n  - Market conditions\n  - Token types (stable vs. volatile)\n  - Trading pools or order books\n  - User’s slippage tolerance\n  - Goal: Optimize trades with minimal slippage, reducing MEV opportunities.\n- **MEV Protect Mode**: A feature in DEXs and Telegram bots routes trades to Jito block engines to prevent sandwich attacks, though it increases fees.\n  - **User Behavior**: Many Telegram bot users skip MEV protection, favoring speed over safety.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **Solana MEV Evolution**: Solana’s MEV landscape is rapidly changing, not yet at a stable equilibrium.\n  -

Tuy nhiên, vượt ra ngoài các thị trường đầu cơ này, một sự chuyển dịch sâu sắc hơn đã bắt đầu diễn ra trong lĩnh vực tiền điện tử — một sự thay đổi được xây dựng dựa trên nhiều năm tự động hóa ngày càng tăng.\n\n- **🤖 Bot chiếm ưu thế**: Hiện đã chiếm phần lớn các giao dịch tiền điện tử (lên tới 90% trong một số phân khúc). Chúng chưa phải là các AI agent hoàn toàn tự chủ — nhưng chưa hẳn đã không. Dẫu vậy, chúng là những tiền thân rõ ràng, ngày càng trổng quát và độc lập hơn theo thời gian.\n\n- **⚡ Bản chất phù hợp**: Cơ sở hạ tầng tiền điện tử đặc biệt phù hợp với các giao dịch tự động và có tính chương trình hóa.\n\n![Header Image](header.png)\n\n# 🤖 Tổng quan về AI Agents và những vấn đề liên quan\n\n### 🤖 AI agent là gì?\nAI agent là **Smart AI Automation**, tự động thực hiện nhiệm vụ thay con người, dựa trên thuật toán AI. Tự động học hỏi, phân tích, quyết định và tương tác với môi trường, như chatbot, bot giao dịch, hay trợ lý ảo, nổi bật nhờ tính tự chủ và hiệu quả.\n\n### ⛓️ Blockchain và NFTs là gì?\n- **Blockchain**: Công nghệ lưu trữ phân tán, lưu trữ dữ liệu trong các khối (block) liên kết, được mã hóa (by chain), đảm bảo tính phi tập trung, minh bạch và an toàn, thường dùng cho tiền điện tử và hợp đồng thông minh.  \n- **🖼️ NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**: Tài sản số độc nhất trên blockchain, đại diện cho quyền sở hữu vật phẩm như nghệ thuật, âm nhạc, hay đồ trong game.  \n*\"NFT giống như Mona Lisa - copy 99.99% vẫn chỉ là bản sao!\"* 😄\n\n---\n![Ai agent Image](work-ai.png)\n\n## ⚖️ Bài toán đặt ra\n\n**Nếu con người ngủ/ngưng hoạt động → Thị trường vẫn chạy**. AI Agent giúp tự động hóa giao dịch nhưng cần giải quyết:\n\n### ✅ Điểm mạnh:\n1. **🛡️ Tự chủ (Autonomy)**: Hoạt động độc lập, không cần giám sát liên tục.  \n2. **⚡ Hiệu quả (Efficiency)**: Kết hợp data on-chain/off-chain để ra quyết định tối ưu.  \n3. **📚 Khả năng học hỏi (Adaptability)**: Cải thiện qua machine learning.  \n\n### ❌ Điểm yếu:\n1. **📉 Phụ thuộc dữ liệu**: Hiệu quả giảm nếu data thiếu/sai.  \n2. **🎨 Thiếu sáng tạo**: Giới hạn trong lập trình.  \n3. **🔓 Rủi ro bảo mật**: Dễ bị tấn công nếu hệ thống không an toàn.  \n\n---\n\n## 🔐 Security Challenge: Bảo vệ Ví Solana\n**Vấn đề**: AI Agent cần truy cập ví nhưng lưu **private key** trong code → Rủi ro bị hack!  \n\n### 💥 Ví dụ thực tế:\n- **3M$ mất trắng** (Banana Gun 9/2024) do lỗi oracle tin nhắn Telegram.  \n- Bot có quyền ví → Giao dịch không mong muốn không thể đảo ngược.  \n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Giải pháp cân bằng Security & Autonomy\n[Turnkey](https://www.turnkey.com/) cung cấp kiến trúc 3 lớp: \n### 1. 🔑 Khóa API Phân Quyền\n- Giới hạn phạm vi hoạt động của agent  \n- Định nghĩa chính sách chi tiết (ký giao dịch, tương tác hợp đồng...)  \n\n### 2. 🛡️ Môi Trường Enclave (AWS Nitro)\n- Cách ly hoàn toàn với bên ngoài  \n- Không lưu trữ/mạng/khả năng sửa đổi  \n\n### 3. ✅ Chứng Thực Công Khai\n- Cryptographic proof xác minh mã nguồn  \n- Reproducible builds đảm bảo tính toàn vẹn  \n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Tương Lai Phát Triển\n- **🤖 Agent tự chủ hoàn toàn**  \n- **🎮 Tích hợp GameFi/NFT**  \n- **🌐 Hệ sinh thái DAO phi tập trung**  \n\n## Kết luận: \nSự kết hợp giữa AI agents và NFT collections không chỉ là xu hướng mà còn là một bước tiến quan trọng trong việc mở rộng tiềm năng của công nghệ số. Từ quản lý tự động đến sáng tạo nghệ thuật, AI đang định hình lại cách chúng ta tương tác với NFT, đồng thời tạo ra các cơ hội mới cho nghệ sĩ, nhà sưu tập và nhà đầu tư.
